## About the Collection
This collection is intended to impart the political, social, artistic, and scientific changes that occurred in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. These “decades of change” are rich with powerful imagery, something that is clearly demonstrated through the collection. The provided posters, photographs, and art pieces accumulate into a visual representation of the culture during this period of American history. Throughout these two decades, the public turned away from conservative Post-WWII American Pie ideologies to radical change that sought to disrupt discriminatory beliefs. This is represented in the photo of the Civil Rights protester, as well as two posters of Martin Luther King Jr. and Fred Hampton. The collection also features images that relate to the Stonewall Uprising, where the LGBTQ+ community found themselves thrust into the spotlight as they fought for equal rights. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, many artistic movements involved challenging the current politics and societal norms, so the addition of the Pop Art pieces within the collection is a representation of the postmodern response to conservative American ideals as the counterculture simultaneously challenged it. Another aspect of this collection is the political climate during these two decades. The Cold War, a presidential assassination, and the protests against the Vietnam War are represented in the collection through photographs and editorial cartoons. Finally, the leaps in scientific progress are also present in the collection through the moon landing and the  concerns around nuclear energy. These themes of change are visually present throughout the entire collection. 

## The Metadata and Userbase
The expected users of this collection are researchers and historians, as well as individuals who are interested in visual art and photography. For this reason, the location metadata indicates the originating institution of each digital artifact. So that interested individuals can know where to go should they wish to see these materials in person. This collection would also appeal to researchers who were interested in topics relating to social justice. Another feature is that each object belongs to one of four main subjects: social movements, politics, art, and scientific advancements. This allows for easier discovery and research.
